Mac is a powerful machine for productivity.
- The current Stickies app and similar apps from the App Store are missing some features that often frustrate users.
- I’ve encountered several of these issues myself, which led me to create this simple Stickies app to help solve some of those frustrations.

# This app is especially useful for people who care deeply about productivity and frequently use Stickies or other note‑taking apps.
